# Data scraping with Instagram 

This projects was done for a small business to help them control their stocks sheet . 
The business has product_img posted on the first picture , and caption on the first line  

Since this was done during boring days , so i wont be updating them ... too lazy lmao  

## Implementations  

- Download all pictures with filename-format = date posted 
- Match all the date of captions and date of pic 
- Output in html using pandas  

## Run Locally
- To run this script use **vscode**  ==> I was using vscode built in ipython kernal for a script file 
this allow me to have a ipython session in .py file 
(Notice if your version doesn't have built ipython , update it ) :) 

- Install dependencies 

    <code> 
        pip3 insall requirement.txt
    </code> 

- Go to the script.py file  
- Add your username , password and target in script.py  
- run the script  
    ```
        python3 script.py
    ```
- the result will be an index.html file 
- Modify the script.py for more export options
